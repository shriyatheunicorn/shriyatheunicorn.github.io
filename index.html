        <h1> Shriya and Aarini</h1>
        <p>Hi! We are friends who met at Scholar's Academy. Our brothers became friends
        first. We really became friends when we met at Aarini's house. We played 
        many board games, and we also painted our own rings. We also had dinner together,
        and has lots of fun. We also met again at Kushaan's (Aarini's brother) 
        birthday. Ever since, we have been amazing friends. We also met last year
         at a tennis class. Aarini's favorite show is Shimmer and Shine, and 
         Shriya's favorite show is Dance Moms.</p>
